Agile components
===

This repository contains the alpha version of the following AGILE components:

Agile Bluetooth Low Energy
---

Exposes the [iot.agile.Protocol](http://agile-iot.github.io/agile-api-spec/docs/html/api.html#iot_agile_Protocol) interface

- DBus interface name **iot.agile.protocol.BLE**
- DBus interface path **/iot/agile/protocol/BLE**

Agile Protocol Manager
---

Exposes the [iot.agile.ProtocolManager](http://agile-iot.github.io/agile-api-spec/docs/html/api.html#iot_agile_ProtocolManager) interface

- DBus interface name **iot.agile.ProtocolManager**
- DBus interface path **/iot/agile/ProtocolManager**

**Example**

The package *iot.agile.protocolmanager.example* contains an example
file (i.e BLEDeviceDiscovery.java) to demonstrate the use of AGILE Protocol Manager to discover BLE devices through DBus interface.

AGILE Device Manager
---

Exposes the [iot.agile.DeviceManager](http://agile-iot.github.io/agile-api-spec/docs/html/api.html#iot_agile_DeviceManager) interface

- DBus interface name **iot.agile.DeviceManger**
- DBus interface path **/iot/agile/DeviceManager**

**Example**

Register BLE Device The package iot.agile.devicemanager.example contains an example file (i.e RegisterDevice.java) to demonstrate the usage of Agile Device Manager for device registration and creation of DBus interface for the registered device

**Additional interfaces**

- [iot.agile.Device](http://agile-iot.github.io/agile-api-spec/docs/html/api.html#iot_agile_Device)
  - DBus interface base name *iot.agile.device.[device name]*
  - DBus interface base path */iot/agile/Device/[device name]*

    **Example**

    - Connect BLE Device(TI SensorTag): The ConnectDevice.java file in iot.agile.devicemanager.example package demonstrates the usage of Agile iot.agile.Device Dbus interface to connect a TI SensorTag device.
    - Read Data: The ReadData.java file in iot.agile.devicemanager.example package demonstrates the usage of iot.agile.Device DBus interface in order to read temperature data from TI SensorTag temperature sensor/service.

HTTP API
---

The DBus API can be used from the HTTP endpoint exposed by default on port `8080`.

See the [HTTP API reference](http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=http://agile-iot.github.io/agile-api-spec/docs/swagger/api.swagger.yml) for details on the exposed endpoints.

To query the endpoint, we suggest using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) by importing the swagger based [API definition](http://agile-iot.github.io/agile-api-spec/docs/swagger/api.swagger.yml)

Launching the API
---

Under the `scripts` directory you can find different scripts to setup and start / stop the modules.

*Note* A `java` 8 compatible JDK and maven (`mvn`) must be already available in the system.

- `./scripts/start.sh` will install (if not available) all the dependencies required to run and start the modules.

  To control which component to start:
  - `./scripts/start.sh ProtocolManager` starts only the Protocol Manager module
  - `./scripts/start.sh DeviceManager` starts only the Device Manager module
  - `./scripts/start.sh BLE` starts only the BLE Protocol module
  - `./scripts/start.sh http` starts only the HTTP API module

- `./scripts/stop.sh` will kill all the modules.

  To control which component to stop (based on `pkill -f` pattern):
  - `./scripts/stop.sh protocolmanager` stop only the Protocol Manager module
  - `./scripts/stop.sh devicemanager` stop only the Device Manager module
  - `./scripts/stop.sh BLE` stop only the BLE Protocol module
  - `./scripts/stop.sh http` stop only the HTTP API module

-  `./scripts/install-deps.sh` is used to setup all the java and native dependencies to a local directory (placed in the `./deps` folder)

Development environment setup
---

To run the examples above installation of the following hardwares and libraries are required:
- Hardwares:
      Bluetooth adapter must be turned on to run the examples  
      TI SensorTag
-  Libraries:
      - Add dbus-java2.7.jar on your local maven repository
      - Add tinyb.1.0.0.jar on your local maven repository
           (https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/tinyb )
      - install libjavatinyb.so shared library  

Execution order:

1. First the BLE Protcol API must run, for this compile and run BLEProtocolImp.java file from iot.agile.protocol.BLE package.

2. Start the Agile protocol manager DBus interface, for this compile and run ProtocolManagerImp.java from iot.agile.ProtocolManager package.

3. Start the device manger DBus interface, by compile and run DeviceManagerImp.java file from iot.agile.DeviceManager package.

4. Compile and run BLEDeviceDiscovery.java file from iot.agile.protocolmanager.example package to discover active BLE devices. This will print the name of all discovered BLE devices.

5. Compile and run RegisterDevice.java file from iot.agile.devicemanager.examples package to register TI SensorTag.
*Prerequisite:* A device must be first discovered before registration.
*Note:* Make sure to set you device address (i.e C4:BE:84:70:69:09) of your TI-Sensor tag.

6. Compile and run ConnectDevice.java from iot.agile.devicemanager.examples package to connect the device (i.e. TI SensorTag)
*Prerequisite:* A device must be registered to be connected.

7. Compile and run ReadData.java from iot.agile.devicemanager.examples package to read current temperature data from the sensor tag.
*Prerequisite:* A device must be connected first.

*Note:* step one to three are all mandatory to run any of the example files provided.

#resin-sync
This resin application allows you to develop quickly on a resin.io device by avoiding the build/download process and directly syncing a folder to a "test" device in the fleet.

> **NB:** You need Oracle JDK 8 installed on your Development Machine, because the java code will be compiled on your Dev machine.

In order to get this new super power you will need to set up a few things on your development computer.

>**NOTE:** This example assumes you are familiar with the basic resin.io workflow and have set up a device and can comfortably push code to it. If you are new to resin.io first have a look at our [getting started guide](http://docs.resin.io/#/pages/installing/gettingStarted.md).

##### Install the Plugin
resin-sync depends on the following:
* node.js > 4.0
* resin-cli > 2.6.0

To setup resin-sync first clone the resin-sync repo to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/resin-io/resin-plugin-sync.git`

Now change into the resin-plugin-sync directory and use npm install to it globally:
```
cd resin-plugin-sync
sudo npm install -g
```

To check that the plugin is properly installed login with the resin-cli:
```
shaun@shaun-desktop:~$ resin login
______          _         _
| ___ \        (_)       (_)
| |_/ /___  ___ _ _ __    _  ___
|    // _ \/ __| | '_ \  | |/ _ \
| |\ \  __/\__ \ | | | |_| | (_) |
\_| \_\___||___/_|_| |_(_)_|\___/

Logging in to resin.io
? How would you like to login? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Web authorization (recommended)
  Credentials
  Authentication token
  I don't have a Resin account!
```

Now run `resin help --verbose` to see if the plugin is enabled. You should see `sync <uuid>` at the bottom:
```
shaun@shaun-desktop:~$ resin help --verbose
Usage: resin [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

Run the following command to get a device started with Resin.io

  $ resin quickstart

Primary commands:

    help [command...]                   show help                          
    quickstart [name]                   getting started with resin.io      
    login                               login to resin.io                  
    app create <name>                   create an application              
    apps                                list all applications              
    app <name>                          list a single application          
    devices                             list all devices                   
    device <uuid>                       list a single device               
    logs <uuid>                         show device logs                   

Installed plugins:

    sync <uuid>                         sync your changes with a device    

Additional commands:
```

##### Setting up the Development Device

Now that you have the resin-cli and resin-sync plugin installed, you need to setup the device-side. This is pretty straightforward and only requires these 2 steps:
1. Enable the deviceURL for the device which you want to use as your development device. This can be done from the `Actions` tab on the device page. If you need help with this, have a look at our [docs on DeviceURLs](http://docs.resin.io/#/pages/management/devices.md#enable-public-device-url).
2. Add an environment variable to the device called AUTH_TOKEN. The value of this variable should be your Auth token found on the preferences page. If you are unsure of how to set a device environment variable check our [docs on Env Vars](http://docs.resin.io/#/pages/management/env-vars.md)
3. Push this repo (sync-java-example) to your resin.io application.

Once the device has pulled the first update and is in the Idle state, you will be ready to start using resin-sync to really speed up your resin.io development.

>** Warning: ** The Auth Token will expire in a month or slightly longer, so you will need to refresh it.

##### Using resin-sync

Now that your device is setup, make some small changes to the java code in `app/` folder and run `resin sync <UUID>` from within the `sync-java-example` directory. Replace `<UUID>` with the 7 digit alphanumeric id shown on the device dashboard. Here is an example:
```
shaun@shaun-desktop:~/Desktop/sync-java-example$ resin sync 510b43d
Connecting with: 510b43d
I will run before syncing to the device...
sending incremental file list
main.js
             36 100%    0.00kB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#1, to-chk=0/2)
Synced, restarting device
```
In about 30seconds, your new Java code should be running on the development device.

>**Note:**  If you need to install dependencies with something like `apt-get install`, then you will still need to go through the build pipeline and do a regular `git push resin master`. Once it is complete, you can resume using resin sync to develop.

##### What is resin-sync.yml
The resin-sync.yml file is a handy file that allows you to describe the behaviour of resin-sync for this repo. In this example it looks like this:
```
source: app/
before: 'javac app/Hello.java'
ignore:
    - .git
    - Dockerfile
    - resin-sync.yml
progress: true
watch: false
```
Here is a short description of what the fields do:

**source:** This defines the directory that will be synced to the device. This will always be synced to `/usr/src/app` on the target device (in the future this will be configurable). In our example we sync our local `app/` directory to `/usr/src/app` so all our java binaries gets synced across.

**before:** The `before` command, allows us to define a pre-sync action, this is useful for compiled languages like go-lang or Java, where we could have this command execute a local cross-compile and then only sync over the binaries that are produced. In this example we have our local machines JDK 8 compile the java and then sync it across to the device. **NB** you need the JDK 8 installed on you development computer. Here you could even use a tool like `make` to handle the build process and just call it from `--before`.

**ignore:** The `ignore` command allows you to list files and directories that resin-sync should ignore when syncing to the device. In this example we ignore `.git`, even though this is strictly not necessary because there is no `.git ` in the `app/` directory we are syncing.

**progress:** This command lets you see which files are being synced across and how fast that is happening. Its mainly useful for debugging and checking what is actually going on.

**watch:** This command allows you to set the resin-sync plugin to continually watch a directory and sync files every time something is changed and saved. **NOTE:** If you do a couple of rapid saves, it will try sync while the container on the device is still restarting, and you will see some errors.

For a more comprehensive list of resin sync commands, run `resin help sync`

##### Some Extra Info

Resin-sync works by setting up an ssh server on the device that listens on port 80. The code is then synced over the resin.io VPN to the device. This means you can use resin-sync even with remote devices anywhere in the world.

It also means you will have ssh automatically set up for you if you want to run some test commands. Just run `ssh root@<DEVICE-IP> -p80`. By default the device side container will pull all the public ssh keys onto the device, so you will not need a password. But if you ssh key is not on the device, then you can access the ssh with the password: `resin`.

##### Current Limitations

Currently the sync can only be done to the `/usr/src/app` directory of the device. Have a look at the base image to see why. [[link](https://github.com/resin-io-library/base-images/pull/49/files#diff-90358446892ac0a322643ed27595fbd9R12)]

Currently there is also a case that if you sync some changes, roll back those change and then commit and push...then you will notice that the synced changes are still running. This is again due to the section of code above. It is recommended that you do a purge of /data on your device before you run the git push.

The security model of resin sync is not yet fully complete, but so long as your development device doesn't fall into a potential attacker's hands, you should not have any issues. This is another thing we're working on improving before full release.
